    <h>The State of the Coast Report, <span style="color:  rgb(0, 204, 150)">explained</span></h>
    <p>The data of this report is obtained from various STACs and the content of this report is generated by the Azure AI.
            This page explains the approach to process individual data from the STACs and relevant literature regarding the datasets. 
            The datasets can be found in the following STACs:</p>
    <p>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openearth/global-coastal-atlas/subsidence_etienne/STAC/data/current/catalog.json</p>
    <p>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openearth/coclicodata/main/current/catalog.json</p>

    <p>Coastal Types: The dataset indicates the sediment composition of a beach at certain transects, 
        which are globally spaced shore-normal transects in every 500m. The transects can either labelled as sandy, muddy, vegetated, coastal cliff or other materials. 
        This dataset is derived from satellite images and other parameters and generated by using a supervised random forest classifier. 
        Details of the methodology can be referred to Breiman et al. (2001).</p>

    <p>The Population: The dataset provides a global population count per pixel at approximately 100m resolution 
        and it is based on the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) 2020 estimates for in total 183 countries.</p>

    <p>Historical Shoreline Change: The dataset provides the annual shoreline position over the period from 1984 to 2021 along 1.8 million transects in the world. 
        The transects are 500m spaced shore-normal transects. The position of shoreline is derived from satellite images. 
        Details of the methodology can be referred to XXXX.</p>

    <p>SSP: SSP stands for Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, which was introduced in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report (AR6). 
        This indicator describes different socioeconomic assumptions, such as population, economic growth, technological development and etc. 
        Details can be referred to the AR6.</p>

    <p>RCP: RCP stands for Representative Concentration Pathway, which was introduced in IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5).
            RCP4.5 and 8.5 describe scenarios with intermediate or very high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and other radiative forcings. 
            RCP4.5 describes a scenario that the CO2 emission will remain around current levels until 2050 and fall but not reach net zero by 2100. 
            RCP8.5 describes a scenario that the CO2 emission will become triple by 2075.</p>

    <p>Sea Level Rise Projection: This is median projections of regional sea level rise from 2020 to 2150, relative to a 1995-2014 baseline. 
        This projection data is originally from the AR6. The projections are based on several scenarios, including SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585. 
        Details of the projection can be found in XXX.</p>

    <p>Future Shoreline Projections: The average shoreline change rate is based on projection of locations of sandy shorelines relative to their reference locations in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. 
        According to Luijendijk et al. (XXXX), the shoreline locations in 2021 and the projected shoreline locations in 2050 and 2100 are defined. 
        The average shoreline change rate is calculated based on the spatial distance difference of the shoreline location between two referenced years and divided by the year difference. 
        The future shoreline location is estimated based on XXXXX. Details can be found in “XXXX” (Luijendijk et al., XXXX ). 
        The erosion and accretion classification system is the same as the one in the historical shoreline change.</p>
