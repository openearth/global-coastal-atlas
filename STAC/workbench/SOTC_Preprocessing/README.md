# Preprocessing Notebooks

This folder contains Python notebooks documenting the preprocessing steps undertaken during the early stages of the project. These notebooks detail the process of downloading and saving wave data from Global Climate Models (GCMs), creating the Transect template, DEM clippers, and other preprocessing tasks essential for project initialization.

## Overview

The Preprocessing Notebooks serve as a vital component in the initial stages of the project, focusing on preparing the necessary data and tools required for subsequent analysis. This includes acquiring wave data from Global Climate Models, setting up templates for transects, clipping Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and performing other preprocessing tasks to ensure data readiness for further analysis.


## Contents

1. **Downloading GCM Wave Data.ipynb**: This notebook outlines the process of acquiring wave data from Global Climate Models (GCMs), including downloading, processing, and saving the data for further analysis.

2. **Transect Template Creation.ipynb**: Describes the creation of a Transect template, including defining the parameters, generating sample transects, and saving the template for future use.

3. **DEM Clipping.ipynb**: Details the process of clipping Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to specific regions of interest, ensuring compatibility with the study area.

4. **Other Preprocessing Tasks.ipynb**: Covers additional preprocessing tasks that were essential in the early stages of the project, such as data cleaning, formatting, or transformation.
