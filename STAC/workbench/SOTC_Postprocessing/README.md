# Global Buffer Circles and ERA5 Workflow

This folder contains files and documentation related to two key components of the project: creating global buffer circles per IPCC subregions and performing Extreme Value analysis for ERA5 data, as well as Bias correction and Ensemble Averaging of Global Climate Models (GCMs)/Wave Watch 3 outputs.

## Global Buffer Circles

The Global Buffer Circles component involves the creation of buffer circles around specific locations corresponding to IPCC subregions. These buffer circles aid in spatial analysis and provide insights into the environmental conditions surrounding each subregion.

## ERA5 Workflow

The ERA5 Workflow focuses on conducting Extreme Value analysis for ERA5 data, along with Bias correction and Ensemble Averaging of Global Climate Models (GCMs)/Wave Watch 3 outputs. This workflow aims to analyze extreme weather events and provide accurate predictions through data processing and analysis techniques.
