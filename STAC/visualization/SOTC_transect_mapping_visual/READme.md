# STAC Dataset Visualization and Risk Assessment

This folder contains scripts and documentation detailing the process of visualizing datasets uploaded to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), mapping them to shoreline monitor transect intersects, and processing them into Hazard, Exposure, and Vulnerability subcomponents. These subcomponents are then combined into a final Risk Level for both Curaçao and the wider Caribbean region. The `Caribbean`, `Curacao`, and `templates` folders serve different purposes in this process.

## Overview

The STAC Dataset Visualization and Risk Assessment project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the environmental risks associated with coastal areas, particularly focusing on Curaçao and the Caribbean. By integrating various datasets and conducting thorough analyses, this project seeks to aid decision-makers in understanding and mitigating potential hazards.

## Folder Structure

- `Caribbean/`: Contains datasets, scripts, and documentation specific to the Caribbean region.
- `Curacao/`: Contains datasets, scripts, and documentation specific to Curaçao.
- `templates/`: Acts as a scrapbook, storing intermediate results, drafts, and experimentation files.

Within each of these folders, you'll find:

- `.pnyb scripts`: Contains scripts used for data visualization, mapping, and processing.
- `documentation/`: Includes documentation outlining the methodologies, data sources, and analysis procedures.
- `plots/`: Stores the final risk assessment results, including visualizations, reports, and summaries.
